This block has 3 main components:
* Polyphse Filter Bank with 64 channels, 50 % overlap, x32 decimation.
* Channel selector to grab 8 channels from the PFB.
* Eight phase-coherent DDSs with frequency/phase settings.

The 8 outputs are independent from each other. The same PFB channels can
be routed multiple times to individual outputs, and apply a different
DDS down-conversion frequency.
